          Robert Moses State Park - Long Island is a 875-acre (3.54 km2) state
          park in southern Suffolk County, New York. The park lies on the
          western end of Fire Island, one of the central barrier islands off the
          southern coast of Long Island, and is known for its five-mile (8.0 km)
          stretch of beaches on the Atlantic Ocean. The park is accessible from
          Long Island by the Robert Moses Causeway across Great South Bay.
          Established as Fire Island State Park in 1908, the park is the oldest
          state park on Long Island. Its current name was given to honor Robert
          Moses, the influential mid-20th century urban planner and former
          president of the Long Island State Park Commission.

          <strong>Access and Hours</strong>
        </br>
          The park is accessible by automobile from the Robert Moses Causeway,
          which connects Fire Island with mainland Long Island. Parking is
          available in four separate fields. Parking fields 2, 4 and 5 have a
          capacity of roughly 1,000 vehicles while the capacity at Field 3 is
          500. Suffolk Transit's S47 route also serves the beach seasonally
          connecting it with the Babylon Long Island Rail Road station on the
          Babylon Branch. The park is open year-round from sunrise to sunset,
          although hours for activities such as swimming and golfing vary by
          season. Portions of the park are open 24 hours a day to fishermen with
          the appropriate permit. Starting in early April, visitors are charged
          a fee for parking at the park. As of 2015, vehicle fees are $8 from 8
          a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekends from mid-April until Memorial Day, after
          which a $10 fee is charged from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekends and
          holidays, and a $10 fee is charged on weekdays from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.
          After Labor Day weekend, vehicle fees are once again $8 from 8 a.m. to
          4 p.m. on weekends only, until mid-November when fees are no longer
          charged.
